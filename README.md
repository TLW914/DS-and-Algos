# Common Data Structures and Algorithms Repo

In this repo, you can find the implementations of a wide variety of algorithms and Data Structures that I have been practicing for technical interviews.
(For common graph algorithms, [click here](https://github.com/velezjose/graph-algorithms).)

1. LRUCache –> implements a Least Recently Used cache with a DoublyLinkedList and a HashMap.
2. Sorting –> common sorting algorithms

Stay tuned for more!
